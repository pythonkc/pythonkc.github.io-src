Summary: How to get the most out of being a PythonKC member

# Getting the Most Out of PythonKC

## Learning Python
* PythonKC is _not_ here to teach you Python for free (sorry; _not sorry_).
* PythonKC is here to _help_ you learn Python.

### Help us help you.
* Don't ask "How do I do _x_?"
* Instead, say "I've tried _x, y, and z_. I'm gettning these _specific_ errors. What am I missing?"
* Don't email us your Python code (or paste large blocks in Slack). Send links to GitHub gists instead.

### But I don't know how to _use_ GitHub!
* [Good Resources for Learning Git and GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/)
* Ask Caleb or Chip; we will help you get started.

## Meet People Who Like Python
* Introduce yourself.
* Give a talk (i.e. a _presentation_).
* [Join](https://pykc-slackipy.herokuapp.com/) the PythonKC Slack.
    * Please give your _real_ name, though. We like to know who we're talking with.

## Meetup.com
* Meetup.com is not the _greatest_, but it's biggest player in the _meet likeminded people_ space.
* Use the [PythonKC discussion boards](http://www.meetup.com/pythonkc/messages/boards/).
    * Looking for a job (or to hire someone)? There's a [PythonKC Job Board](http://www.meetup.com/pythonkc/messages/boards/forum/20397477).
    * We've also got a discussion board showing [discounts](http://www.meetup.com/pythonkc/messages/boards/thread/48671344) on products and services our sponsors offer to PythonKC members.
